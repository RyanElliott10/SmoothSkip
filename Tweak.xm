// IMPLEMENTATION IDEA: On press of skip, change the song's duration in the dict. Then, add an if somewhere in a controller that checks 
// against the modified dictionary. If the position is within 8 of the new duration (pulled from the dict), call the method
// that is normally called when the song naturally skips

// PLAN:
// 1. Clean up existing code and remove unneeded methods (DONE)
// 2. Find the method that is called when the song naturally skips
// 3. Add the conditional that checks against the dictionary
//    3a. This might be difficult because it might not have the right variables. To solve this, just add in variables in the 
// 		  header and initalize them in the init method
// 4. Pull the user's crossfade duration
//    4a. This might end up in the sections setting of the tweak
// 5. Test

// Changed the data in here persists through a single state. As soon as a user
// changes the state (i.e. pauses), the data is reset, which is actually fine.
